# üõ† Predictive Maintenance System

A machine learning-powered solution designed to predict equipment failures before they happen. This tool helps industries and manufacturers reduce downtime, improve safety, and optimize maintenance schedules using real-world sensor data and advanced classification models.

## üåç About the Project

Unplanned machinery failures can lead to significant downtime, revenue loss, and even hazardous conditions in industrial settings. This project aims to solve this challenge by using machine learning to forecast potential equipment failures with high accuracy.

The goal is to provide a lightweight and effective system that can:
- Analyze historical sensor and operational data
- Predict the likelihood of specific failure types
- Assist engineers in making data-driven maintenance decisions
- Extend the life of critical machinery

This project is ideal for industrial applications, academic research, and smart factory implementations.

## üåü Features

- *Multi-Class Failure Prediction*  
  Classifies multiple failure types (e.g., Heat Dissipation, Tool Wear, Power Failure) with strong accuracy using CatBoost.

- *Balanced Dataset via SMOTE*  
  Handles class imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique for improved generalization.

- *Robust Evaluation Metrics*  
  Evaluated using Accuracy, F1-Score, MCC, and Confusion Matrix to ensure model reliability.

- *Model Deployment Ready*  
  Trained model and scaler are saved using joblib for easy integration into production environments.

## ‚öô How It Works

1. User inputs operational values like temperature, torque, speed, and tool wear.
2. The system processes the input using the trained CatBoost model and pre-fitted scaler.
3. The model predicts the likelihood and type of failure.
4. The prediction is displayed on the web app along with a class label (e.g., "No Failure", "Heat Dissipation Failure", etc.).
